  How to deploy a new CAP-based application
---

Deploying a multi-tenant CAP application involves defining several key resources provided by the CAP Operator. These resources help manage the application's runtime components and external traffic routing.

## Key Resources

1. **CAPApplication** (`capapplications.sme.sap.com`): This resource is namespaced, meaning it is confined to a specific namespace within your cluster. It represents the application itself.

2. **CAPApplicationVersion** (`capapplicationversions.sme.sap.com`): Also namespaced, this resource specifies the version of the application you are deploying. It ensures that all runtime components like deployments, services, and jobs are created with the specified image version in the same namespace.

3. **Domain Resources**: These resources determine how external traffic reaches your application and how DNS and TLS settings are applied. You can choose between:
   - **Domain** (`domains.sme.sap.com`): A namespaced resource intended for a single application, typically for internal domain use within your application or cluster.
   - **ClusterDomain** (`clusterdomains.sme.sap.com`): A cluster-scoped resource that can be used across multiple applications within the cluster.

## Deployment Process

To deploy your application, ensure that the `CAPApplication` and `CAPApplicationVersion` resources are created within the same namespace. This allows the CAP Operator to manage all associated application runtime components. For external traffic management, define either a `Domain` or `ClusterDomain` resource based on your application's needs.

```yaml
apiVersion: sme.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: Domain
metadata:
  namespace: cap-app-01
  name: cap-app-01-primary
spec:
  domain: my.cluster.shoot.url.k8s.example.com
  ingressSelector:
    app: istio-ingressgateway
    istio: ingressgateway
  tlsMode: Simple
  dnsMode: Wildcard
```

The `ClusterDomain` resource is not namespaced and is suited for global or shared domain configurations. For example, multiple applications can share the same external domain. If needed, either create a new one or reuse an existing one in the cluster. See [API Reference](../../reference/#sme.sap.com/v1alpha1.ClusterDomain).

```yaml
apiVersion: sme.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterDomain
metadata:
  name: common-external-domain
spec:
  domain: my.example.com
  ingressSelector:
    app: istio-ingressgateway
    istio: ingressgateway
  tlsMode: Simple
  dnsMode: Subdomain
```

The `CAPApplication` resource describes the high-level attributes of an application such as the SAP BTP account where it is hosted, the consumed SAP BTP services, list of `Domain` and `ClusterDomain` resources etc. See [API Reference](../../reference/#sme.sap.com/v1alpha1.CAPApplication).

```yaml
apiVersion: sme.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: CAPApplication
metadata:
  name: cap-app-01
  namespace: cap-app-01
spec:
  btpAppName: cap-app-01 # <-- short name (similar to SAP BTP XSAPPNAME)
  btp:
    services:
      - class: xsuaa # <-- SAP BTP service technical name
        name: app-uaa # <-- name of the service instance
        secret: cap-app-01-uaa-bind-cf # <-- secret containing the credentials to access the service existing in the same namespace
      - class: saas-registry
        name: app-saas-registry
        secret: cap-app-01-saas-bind-cf
      - class: service-manager
        name: app-service-manager
        secret: cap-app-01-svc-man-bind-cf
      - class: destination
        name: app-destination
        secret: cap-app-01-dest-bind-cf
      - class: html5-apps-repo
        name: app-html5-repo-host
        secret: cap-app-01-html5-repo-bind-cf
      - class: html5-apps-repo
        name: app-html5-repo-runtime
        secret: cap-app-01-html5-rt-bind-cf
      - class: portal
        name: app-portal
        secret: cap-app-01-portal-bind-cf
  domainRefs:
  - kind: Domain
    name: cap-app-01-primary # <-- reference to Domain resource in the same namespace
  - kind: ClusterDomain
    name: common-external-domain # <-- reference to ClusterDomain resource in the cluster (either new or existing)
  globalAccountId: global-account-id
  provider:
    subDomain: cap-app-01-provider
    tenantId: e55d7b5-279-48be-a7b0-aa2bae55d7b5
```

The `CAPApplicationVersion` describes the different components of an application version including the container images to be used and the services consumed by each component. See [API Reference](../../reference/#sme.sap.com/v1alpha1.CAPApplicationVersion).

The `CAPApplicationVersion` must be created in the same namespace as the `CAPApplication` and refers to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: sme.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: CAPApplicationVersion
metadata:
  name: cav-cap-app-01-1
  namespace: cap-app-01
spec:
  capApplicationInstance: cap-app-01 # <-- reference to CAPApplication in the same namespace
  version: "1" # <-- semantic version
  registrySecrets:
    - regcred
  workloads:
    - name: cap-backend
      consumedBTPServices: # <-- these are services used by the application server (already defines as part of CAPApplication resource). Corresponding credential secrets will be mounted onto the component pods as volumes.
        - app-uaa
        - app-service-manager
        - app-saas-registry
      deploymentDefinition:
        type: CAP # <-- indicates the CAP application server
        image: app.some.repo.example.com/srv/server:0.0.1
        env:
          - name: CDS_ENV
            value: production
          - name: CDS_CONFIG
            value: '{ "requires":{"cds.xt.DeploymentService":{"hdi": { "create":{ "database_id": "16e25c51-5455-4b17-a4d7-43545345345" } } } } }'
    - name: app-router
      consumedBTPServices:
        - app-uaa
        - app-destination
        - app-saas-registry
        - app-html5-repo-runtime
        - app-portal
      deploymentDefinition:
        type: Router
        image: app.some.repo.example.com/approuter/approuter:0.0.1
        env:
          - name: PORT
            value: 4000
          - name: TENANT_HOST_PATTERN
            value: "^(.*).(my.cluster.shoot.url.k8s.example.com|my.example.com)"
    - name: service-content
      consumedBTPServices:
        - app-uaa
        - app-html5-repo-host
        - app-portal
      jobDefinition:
        type: Content
        image: app.some.repo.example.com/approuter/content:0.0.1
        backoffLimit: 1
```

> NOTE: The example above is a minimal `CAPApplicationVersion` that can be deployed. For a more supported configuration and their explanations, see [here](../resources/capapplicationversion).

The controller component of CAP Operator reacts to these objects and creates further resources, which constitute a running application:

- Deployment (and service) for the application server with credentials (from secrets) to access SAP BTP services injected as `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable
- Deployment (and service) for the approuter with destination mapping to the application server and subscription server (for the tenant provisioning route)
- Job for the version content deployer
- TLS certificates for the domains provided using either ["Gardener" cert-management](https://github.com/gardener/cert-management) or [cert-manager.io cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager)
- Istio gateway resource for the application domains

> The content deployer is used to deploy content or configuration to SAP BTP services, before using them.

Once these resources are available, the `CAPApplicationVersion` status changes to `Ready`. **The controller proceeds to automatically create an object of type `CAPTenant`, which corresponds to the tenant of the provider subaccount.** Please see [tenant subscription](./tenant-provisioning.md) for details on how the `CAPTenant` resource is reconciled.

> The `CAPApplicationVersion` resource is meant to be immutable - it's spec should not be modified once it is deployed. This is also prevented by our web-hooks which we recommend to always keep active (default).
